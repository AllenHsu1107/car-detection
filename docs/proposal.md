# Project Proposal
## 1. Motivation & Objective

It is important to maintain a safe distance between cars while driving to avoid coliision. In California, this distance is often called the "3-second rule", which means the distance between your vehicle and the vehicle in front should exceed the travel distance of your current speed in 3 seconds.

We aim to make a driving assistance which detected the current speed of your car and the car in front, as well as the distance between the two vehicles. If the distance violates the 3-second rule, we warn the driver.

Additionally, we also make use of this concept to the car in the back, which means the device will also detect the distance and the speed of the car behind, and flashing a warning sign to the back car is the distance is too short.

## 2. State of the Art & Its Limitations

Today, distance detection is often achieved by radar, which may possibly cause problems while driving on curve roads, where radar signals are less likely to successfully reanch the car in front.

## 3. Novelty & Rationale

Instead of radar, we use
