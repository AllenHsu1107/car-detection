# Abstract

The project aims to enhance road safety by developing a driving assistance system that monitors and alerts drivers when their vehicle violates the "3-second rule" distance between cars. Using computer vision technology, the system assesses the speed and distance between the driver's car and the vehicles ahead and behind. It employs various methods, including license plate detection, multi-angle camera analysis, and lane positioning to accurately calculate distances. However, challenges such as resolution limitations, multiple license plate detection, and sudden lane changes pose obstacles to the system's accuracy. To address these challenges, strategies involving higher resolution cameras, advanced algorithms, and alternative depth calculation methods are proposed.
