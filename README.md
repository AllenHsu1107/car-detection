# Front and Back Car Distance Detection

In this project, we aim to detect the distance between you and the car in front. If the distance is shorter than the required safe distance of your current speed, a warning is flashed to the drive.

Moreover, we can even further enhance this feature to the car behind. That is, if the distance between you and the car behind is shorter than safe distance of its current speed, we flash a light saying "TOO CLOSE" to the back car.
